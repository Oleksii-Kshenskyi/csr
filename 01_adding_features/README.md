# Researching adding new features to a pre-existing application
This is a small C++ project that is a part of CSR (coding style research).
It is meant to start looking for a good method of adding new features to a pre-existing codebase.

# How it works
The project is built with Unix makefiles. It's a small C++ application that parses a very simple config file similar to .ini/.toml. The project is done in 2 phases.
- Phase 1: adding the very basics of config file parsing from scratch.
- Phase 2: implementing a new feature into the parser that has to change most of the project structure in order to be implemented.
The data I'm interested in is in the Phase 2 stage.
